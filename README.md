# ðŸŒŒ Sadman Sakib â€” Portfolio Website

This project is basically a **personal portfolio website**,  
where I tried to apply almost **every bit of CSS I knew** at the time.  

From gradient text to hover effects on cards and buttons â€”  
this site was me experimenting with **creativity + CSS tricks**  
while building something that actually represents me.

## ðŸ“– About
- A **portfolio-style website** featuring my name, intro, and links.  
- Designed with a **dark theme** (because I love dark colors ðŸŒ‘).  
- Every element (cards, buttons, text) has **hover effects** or **gradient styling**.  
- Built purely with **HTML + CSS** while practicing fundamentals.  

---

## ðŸš€ What I Learned
- Using **CSS gradients** for text and buttons.  
- Styling hover states for interactive design.  
- Combining dark backgrounds with neon-like highlights.  
- Structuring a personal portfolio layout from scratch.  

---

## âš¡ Highlights
- Minimal **intro section** with name + social icons.  
- Gradient hover effects across multiple components.  
- A creative playground where I pushed my beginner CSS skills.

## ðŸ’¡ Reflections
This website might not be the most polished,  
but it was a huge step in learning how to make a site feel *alive*.  

It captures both my **love for dark themes**  
and my curiosity in trying every CSS effect I could learn.

## ðŸ”® Next Steps
- Rebuild a modern portfolio with **React + Tailwind**.  
- Keep this version as a **snapshot** of my early CSS journey.
